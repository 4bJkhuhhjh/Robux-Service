#Robux Service
Welcome to the Robux Service Project! This project enables users to login, request Robux purchases, and facilitates secure transactions between the customer and admin.
Features
User Login: Users can log into the platform securely.
Robux Request: Users can request to buy Robux directly from the platform.
Admin Approval: Admins review and approve requests.
Quick Login Code: Upon approval, admins send a quick login code to the user to facilitate the process.
Payment QR Code: Admins provide a QR code image for secure payment.
Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): Users can submit a 2FA code if required.
Request Cancellation: Users have the option to cancel their request at any time.
How It Works
User Registration and Login:
Users register and log into the system to access services.
Requesting Robux:
Navigate to the request section after login and submit a request to purchase Robux.
Approval Process:
An admin reviews the request and, upon approval, sends a quick login code to the user.
Payment:
Users receive a QR code image from the admin for payment processing.
Finalizing Purchase:
Users may send a 2FA code if prompted during the transaction.
The process is complete, and users receive their purchased Robux.
Cancellation:
Users can cancel their request at any point before final approval/payment.
